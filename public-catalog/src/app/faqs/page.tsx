          <Card title="How does Studio work?">
            <p>
              Studio takes the prompt you write and routes it into the currently enabled generation engine(s). The output is an image you can preview and
              use for products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some designs are created by our fractal engine (Julia + Mandelbrot), and some are created by other generators depending on configuration. The
              goal is always the same: produce original, high-contrast artwork that prints cleanly on fabric.

                Checkout collects shipping info and payment via Stripe.

              <li>
                After payment succeeds, our backend creates the Printify fulfillment order so it can be printed and shipped.

          <Card title="Why does social login sometimes keep resetting (Meta/Instagram/Facebook)?">
            <p>
              Some browsers and privacy tools block the cookies and redirects required for OAuth login (the “Sign in to Instagram/Facebook” flow). When that
              happens, the developer console or login screen can refresh and appear to erase what you just typed.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold text-white">Fix checklist</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Turn off ad blockers and tracker blockers for the login domain (for Meta setup this is often developers.facebook.com).</li>
              <li>Disable privacy, cookie, and script-blocking extensions temporarily while you complete the setup.</li>
              <li>Open a Private/Incognito window and try the login again.</li>
              <li>Try Chrome or Edge if your browser keeps resetting the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After you finish linking accounts, you can re-enable your blockers. If login is still blocked, make sure your Meta App Domains and Valid OAuth
              Redirect URIs include your exact site domain (pixelqrypt.com and www.pixelqrypt.com).

            <p>
              Printify is our production partner integration that handles print-on-demand fulfillment: we upload the exact print-ready image, map it to a
              product/variant, and submit the order to Printify for printing and shipping.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means you are buying a real physical product, not just a digital image.

          <Card title="What is Real Quantum Generation - $9.99?">
            <p>
              Real Quantum Generation is a studio-first generation mode. Before the image runs, you unlock a real quantum-backed generation path and then
              create the artwork with origin-record messaging tied to that generation.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Your generation path is positioned as a premium creative choice made in Studio, not a late checkout add-on.</li>
              <li>You receive origin-record messaging and downloadable proof scaffolding after a real quantum generation.</li>
              <li>Checkout stays focused on merch, shipping, and Stripe payment for the physical product.</li>

          <Card title="Julia sets and Mandelbrot (the fractal basics)">
            <p className="font-semibold text-white">Commercial version (for quick reading)</p>
            <p>
              Julia + Mandelbrot fractal fusion: Julia uses a fixed equation repeated on every pixel; Mandelbrot uses the pixel itself as the equation’s
              starting point; we blend them mathematically into one sharp, printable pattern for your shirt.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold text-white mt-4">Full explanation (if you want the details)</p>
            <p>
              Julia sets are a family of fractal patterns related to the Mandelbrot set. At a high level, they come from repeatedly applying an equation
              and observing whether values “escape” to infinity or stay bounded.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Pick a starting value x (often a complex number).</li>
              <li>Apply a function repeatedly, like x → x² + c (c is fixed for the whole image).</li>
              <li>If the sequence escapes (grows beyond a threshold), the starting point is outside the set; otherwise it is inside.</li>
              <li>Coloring is usually based on how fast it escapes, producing the familiar gradients and boundaries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-semibold text-white">How Mandelbrot differs</p>
            <p>
              The Mandelbrot set uses the same iteration rule x → x² + c, but c changes per pixel: for each point you test, that point is the c value. In a
              Julia set, c is fixed and you vary only the starting x across the plane.

                  <li>Those sampled probabilities modulate fractal parameters and interference math.</li>
                  <li>Julia + Mandelbrot are fused into a single line-field (unless the prompt says no mandelbrot).</li>
